		<h3 title="Our tactile system involves the information we receive through our skin. It includes two roles: a discriminative role and a protective role.
		Discrimination includes fine touch, pressure and vibrations. Discriminative touch allows us to determine the shape and feel of an object without first seeing what the object looks like.
		The protective role provides information such as the perception of temperature and pain and also the sensations of an itch or tickle (Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) Australia, 2010). Some students may have difficulty discriminating tactile input (e.g. rough, smooth, silky) and may respond with sensitivity or avoidance or not notice. Some students are sensitive to touch or tactile input because their brain responds in fright/flight/fight - over-responsive protective system. Some students seek out tactile input (e.g. touching different textures) as it gives them information, joy or satisfies a craving."><table><tr><td>LEARNING THROUGH TOUCH -TACTILE PROCESSING</td><td> <div id="chart3" style="width:80px; height:80px;"> </div> </td></tr></table></h3>

		<h3 title="Vestibular processing refers to movement, balance sensations and orientation in space. These are the combined functions of the semicircular canals of the inner ear, basal ganglia, cerebellum and the cerebral motor cortex. This system regulates the feelings of motion such as balance, acceleration, deceleration, starts and stops, direction, rhythm, and creates the stores patters of movement? (Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired, 2010). The hair cells inside the semicircular canals are activated according to position and movement of the head in relation to gravity. Vestibular processing and auditory processing are closely related as they are one apparatus and share nerves and blood vessels. For example, individuals with inner ear infections can often experience difficulties with balance and some students with auditory processing issues often seek out vestibular movement. The vestibular system highly influences alertness levels and combines with the proprioceptive and visual systems to provide an understanding of the body in space and the movement of the head in relation to the body and the environment. Many of our students have challenges with vestibular information processing. This needs to be addressed carefully and urgently as accurate vestibular processing is essential for function in daily life."><table><tr><td>LEARNING THROUGH MOVEMENT -VESTIBULAR PROCESSING</td><td> <div id="chart4" style="width:80px; height:80px;"> </div> </td></tr></table></h3>

		<h3 title="Our auditory system involves the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear, or pinna, collects sounds from the environment, which travels through the ear canal into the middle ear. The middle ear changes the sounds into vibrations, causing the eardrum to vibrate, and to move tiny bones called ossicles, which help deliver the vibrations to the inner ear (Crossman & Neary, 2010). These vibrations enter the cochlea, a part of the inner ear, causing tiny hairs within the cochlear to move. This creates nerve signals that are sent to the brain via the cochlear fibres of the vestibulocochlear nerve (Crossman & Neary, 2010). Auditory and vestibular movement processing are closely linked (as seen in music and movement). Many of our students have audiology tests that show normal hearing; however the problem lies in their brain's processing of auditory information not the acuity of their hearing.

		<h3 title="Vision begins when light rays enter the eye through our cornea. The cornea and our lens channel these rays to the retina, which is at the back of the eye (Vision Australia, 2012). Within the retina, we have photoreceptor cells, which turn the light rays into nerve impulses. These impulses carry visual information to the occipital lobe of the cerebral hemisphere in our brain, via the optic nerve (Crossman & Neary, 2010). This is where visual perception and processing occurs. Many of our students have vision tests that show normal eye-sight with no need for corrective lenses, however the problem lies in their brain's ability to process visual sensory information not the acuity of their eyes. Some students have benefitted from wearing tinted lenses (such as Irlen lenses) which help to manage the distortions caused by their visual processing system. Visual motor integration, eye-hand coordination, eye-foot coordination are dependent on accurate processing of visual sensory information."><table><tr><td>LEARNING THROUGH SIGHT -VISUAL PROCESSING</td><td> <div id="chart6" style="width:80px; height:80px;"> </div> </td></tr></table></h3>

		<h3 title="The Gustatory System involves receptors within our taste buds in our tongue, mouth and throat that transmit information to the brain, where specific tastes are identified (SPD Australia, 2010). There are four different tastes that our taste buds identify and send our brain information about: sweet, sour, bitter and salt. These tastes, as well as the texture and temperature of foods, combine with our olfactory system to perceive taste and flavour. Many students impose restrictions on their own diets due to sensitivities and fears in this system. This is a primal protective mechanism that may be due to a metabolic issue, allergy or intolerance, poor digestion (e.g. chronic constipation), challenges with chewing and processing food or liquid or distortions in the perception of taste and texture, e.g. some people describe a constant metallic taste in their mouth due to an imbalance of minerals in their metabolic system.
		
		The Olfactory system senses and processes smells. When we notice a smell, information is taken to the amygdala in our brains through the olfactory nerve. Unlike the other sensory systems that transport nerve impulses through the spinal cord and the brain stem, the olfactory nerve attaches directly to the forebrain, in particular the olfactory bulb located on the frontal lobe, just above the nose (Crossman & Neary, 2010). Olfactory information further travels to the limbic system, which is responsible for our emotions, behaviour and memories (SPD Australia, 2010). The use of fragrances can therefore be powerful in altering moods, emotions and alertness levels."><table><tr><td>LEARNING THROUGH TASTE - GUSTATORY PROCESSING  AND LEARNING THROUGH SMELL - OLFACTORY PROCESSING</td><td> <div id="chart7" style="width:80px; height:80px;"> </div> </td></tr></table></h3>
